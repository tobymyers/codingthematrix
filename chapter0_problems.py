#problem 0.3.22: show that f and g are functions and f 0 g is invertible therefore
# u and v are both independently invertible
# u    v    u0v
# 1-2 2-1  1-1
# 2-3 3-2  2-2
# 3-4 4-3  3-3
# --5 5--  - - -

#to be invertible, a function must be both onto and one-to-one
#in u, 5 is in the co-domain but there's no corresponding value in the domain, so it's not onto
#therefore u is cannot be invertible
#in v, 5 is in the domain but does not map to anything in the co-domain, so v is not one-to-one
#therefore, u cannot be invertible, even though u0v is invertible
