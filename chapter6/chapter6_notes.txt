steps of simple authentication scheme revisited
# if the number of vectors in a set is greater than the cardinality of any given vector, i.e. if there are M n vectors and
M > n, then the span of the set is likely to be the whole field.  This is an intuitive fact.  The cardinality of the basis can't be
more than the cardinality of the domain of the vectors, so if you've got vectors over r3, and you've got say 10 of them, it's pretty likely
you have a basis in there, meaning the Span is all of r3.

In the context of the simple authentication scheme, this is important because it means that once Eve has a number of vectors and responses > the cardinality of the challenge veetor,
eve is likely to be able to compute the answer in all cases, because the span of the vectors is likely to be all of GF2.

Eve's check algorithm for challenge vector i (cvi):
#1 collect challenge vector and response.
#2 check to see if challenge vector is in set of already collected challenge vectors.
#If yes, use corresponding response
#Else:
#see if challenge vector is in Span of previously collected challenge vectors by making a matrix out of challenge vectors - cvi and solving for cvi
#if solution found, compute linear combination of corresponding responses to find answer.

A crucial fact here is that the solution set to Ax = b == is x + Null A.  This means that if A is linearly indpendent, then x must be a valid solution, so
Eve can use solver.
AMENDMENT:  to make sure she doesn't get an incorrect answer from solver, Eve should try to find a basis for Span(A) out of the given a vectors.

dimension == size of a basis for a vector space. i.e. 2 for R2 [0,1][1,0]
rank == dimension.  I see no fundamental difference.  dimension starts from a Vector Space, rank from a span.  which tends to be a vector space
